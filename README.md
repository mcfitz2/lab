lab
========

This repository contains (almost) all of the configuration and code that runs my Home Lab. 

Goals for this repository:
* Everything except secrets is in the repository
* All configuration and setup is done via Ansible
* All projects that are not intended for public consumption should reside in this repository. Once deemed ready for public consumption, it will be moved to a separate repository. 
* Best practices followed - linting, testing, etc
